# verticalAlignment

[verticalAlignment](https://github.com/danieldrasdo/verticalAlignment) is a quick template I threw together for vertically aligning inline-block elements.

1. If you find something awry with my code, I'd appreciate if you could create a new issue for me.
2. Most importantly, don't laugh at my `code`.\*

\* *A slight giggle is fine.*
